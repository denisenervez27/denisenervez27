        <h1>REFLECTION: "My Online Class Journey"</h1>
		<p style="border: 3px solid tomato; padding: 2px;"><i>Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i></p>

		<p>This is my reflection. Staying at home while having classes online is dull and frustrating. I have been under pressure for the past few weeks. It's upsetting because I lack the motivation, inspiration, and courage to do all my schoolworks on a daily basis. Anxiety is one of the reasons for that. I am having some difficulties with the new learning system. I get frustrated sometimes due to the poor internet connection. Sometimes, I get disconnected from meetings and my laptop is often laggy, to the point where I can't join our class sometimes. Despite the difficulties that I've encountered, I had a good time while having an online class. My teachers often tell jokes, participate in fun activities such as laughing, dancing, even host a Halloween themed class. My personal recommendation for improving this type of learning is to not put too much pressure on the learners and to not give them too much work. I just want to say that I appreciate our teachers for still teaching us, despite our current situation. I am thankful that I have the privilege to still study because some students don't have the luxury to study during the pandemic.</p>
